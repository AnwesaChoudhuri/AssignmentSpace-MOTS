## PointTrack(ECCV2020 ORAL): Segment as Points for Efficient Online Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation

## APOLLO MOTS (v1) is currently available. [APOLLO MOTS (code: vqp8)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kCK6tgoYEk-mnogMa94ZMQ).

This codebase implements **PointTrack** (and its extention **PointTrackV2**), a highly effective framework for multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) described in:

}
```

PointTrackV2 is submitted to TPAMI.

**PointTrack presents a new learning strategy for pixel-wise feature learning on the 2D image plane, which has proven to be effective for instance association.**

Our network architecture adopts [SpatialEmbedding](https://github.com/davyneven/SpatialEmbeddings) as the segmentation sub-network. 
The current ranking of PointTrack is available in [KITTI leader-board](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_mots.php). Until now (07/03/2020), PointTrack++ still ranks first for both cars and pedestrians.
The detailed task description of MOTS is avaliable in [MOTS challenge](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/page/mots).  


## Getting started

This codebase showcases the proposed framework named PointTrack for MOTS using the KITTI MOTS dataset. 

### Prerequisites
Dependencies: 
- Pytorch 1.3.1 (and others), please set up an virtual env and run:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Python 3.6 (or higher)
- [KITTI Images](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_tracking_image_2.zip) + [Annotations](https://www.vision.rwth-aachen.de/media/resource_files/instances.zip)

Note that the scripts for evaluation is included in this repo. After images and instances (annotations) are downloaded, put them under **kittiRoot** and change the path in **repoRoot**/config.py accordingly. 
The structure under **kittiRoot** should looks like:

```
kittiRoot
│   images -> training/image_02/ 
│   instances
│   │    0000
│   │    0001
│   │    ...
│   training
│   │   image_02
│   │   │    0000
│   │   │    0001
│   │   │    ...  
│   testing
│   │   image_02
│   │   │    0000
│   │   │    0001
│   │   │    ... 
```

## Pretrained weights
We provide fine-tuned models on KITTI MOTS (for cars):
- SpatialEmbedding for cars.
- PointTrack for cars.
You can download them via [Baidu Disk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Mk9JWNcM1W08EAjhyq0yLA) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14Hn4ZztfjGUYEjVd-9FRNB5a-CtBkPXc).
- testset segs can be found in the folder 'testset_segs'.


## Testing

You can download pretrained models from the above links. Save these weight file under **repoRoot**/pointTrack_weights.

1.To generate the instance segmentation results:

```
$ python -u test_mots_se.py car_test_se_to_save
```
The segmentation result will be saved according to the config file **repoRoot**/config_mots/car_test_se_to_save.py.

2.To test PointTrack on the instance segmentation results:
```
$ python -u test_tracking.py car_test_tracking_val
```

The pretrained model gets 85.51 sMOTSA for cars on the validation set. 


## Training of PointTrack
The training procedure of instance association is as follows.

1.To generate the segmentation result on the validation set as the instruction of the first step in Testing.

2.To generate the instance DB from videos:
```
$ python -u datasets/MOTSInstanceMaskPool.py
```

3.Change the line which loads weights to the default path as follows:
```
checkpoint_path='./pointTrack_weights/PointTrack.pthCar' --> checkpoint_path='./car_finetune_tracking/checkpoint.pth'
```

4.Afterwards start training:
```
$ python -u train_tracker_with_val.py car_finetune_tracking
```
The best tracker on the validation set will be saved under the folder specified in **repoRoot**/config_mots/car_finetune_tracking.py.


## Training of SpatialEmbedding

Note that the training of SpatialEmbedding needs KITTI object detection left color images as well as the KINS annotations.
Please download images from [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_object_image_2.zip), and unzip the zip file under **kittiRoot**.
Please download two KINS annotation json files from [instances_train.json,instances_val.json](https://github.com/qqlu/Amodal-Instance-Segmentation-through-KINS-Dataset), and put files under **kittiRoot**.

For the training of SpatialEmbedding, we follow the original training setting of [SpatialEmbedding](https://github.com/davyneven/SpatialEmbeddings). 
Different foreground weights are adopted for different classes (200 for cars and 50 for pedestrians). In this following, we take cars for example to explain training procedures. 

0.As there are many in-valid frames in MOTS that contain no cars, we only select these valid frames for training SpatialEmbedding.
 ```
$ python -u datasets/MOTSImageSelect.py
 ```

1.To parse KINS annotations, run:
```
$ python -u datasets/ParseKINSInstance.py
```
After this step, KINS annotations are saved under **kittiRoot**/training/KINS/ and **kittiRoot**/testing/KINS/.

2.To generate these crops do the following:
```
$ python -u utils/generate_crops.py
```
After this step, crops are saved under **kittiRoot**/crop_KINS. (roughly 92909 crops)

3.Afterwards start training on crops: 
```
$ python -u train_SE.py car_finetune_SE_crop
```

4.Afterwards start finetuning on KITTI MOTS with BN fixed:
```
$ python -u train_SE.py car_finetune_SE_mots
```

## Q&A
1. Where is the APOLLO MOTS?
- As suggested by ECCV reviewers, APOLLO MOTS should be revised before publish.

2. Why is the training of **Temporal Seed Consistency** not included in this repo?
- In PointTrack++, we find that the improvement of the temporal seed consistency is minor. Therefore, in this repo, we provide this simplified version for easy usage.

3. The schedule of PointTrack++.
- We are working on cleaning the code of PointTrack++. It will be publicly available soon.
